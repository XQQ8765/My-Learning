		<b>Dear Employees</b>,
		</p>
		<p>	
		<b>You may have already heard the news today that</b> Quest <b>entered into an agreement with</b> Insight Venture Partners to become a privately held company. <b>I've attached to this email</b> the news release and an FAQ which provide more detail about the agreement. <b>I also wanted to share my perspective and to explain why I believe this is good news.</b>
		</p>	
		<p>	
		<b>From an operations perspective</b>, we expect Quest to <b>continue in much the same way as before</b>. We plan to <b>remain a market leader in</b> enterprise systems management software <b>with a focus on continued innovation and superior service</b>. 
		</p>	
		<p>	
		<b>Under this agreement</b>, we would no longer <b>be listed as</b> a public company. The Company would partner with Insight Venture Partners, an early investor in Quest. Insight understands and appreciates the value and the prospects for our business and is committed to Quest¡¯s future success. <b>I believe this new structure will provide even greater flexibility in the marketplace as</b> Quest <b>executes its strategies to meet the needs of our customers</b>, while <b>providing exciting career opportunities for you and your fellow employees</b>. 
		</p>	
		<p>	
		<b>I am committed to the future of our business</b>, and under this agreement, I would continue as Chairman and CEO and maintain a large ownership interest in this company.  <b>I believe strongly in Quest and am excited about where we are headed</b>. 
		</p>
		<p>	
		<b>Importantly</b>, <b>there are several more steps until </b>any <b>potential transaction</b> is completed. The major steps are described in the news release. We <b>expect</b> the transaction to close <b>during the third quarter of this year</b>. 
		</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>but here's the <b>gist</b>...</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Other thoughts, concerns, or ideas are <b>appreciated</b>...but let's <b>keep this within R&D until</b> we have <b>consensus</b> about these new plans.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>This was an <b>oversight</b> by me...</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>UnsafeSequence in Listing 1.1, which <b>is supposed to</b> generate a sequence of unique integer values, <b>offers a simple illustration</b> of how the interleaving of actions in multiple threads can <b>lead to undesirable results</b>. It <b>behaves correctly</b> in a single-threaded environment, but in a multithreaded environment does not.

		<p>
		<b>Diagrams like Figure 1.1 depict</b> possible interleavings of operations in different threads.

		<p>Reentrancy <b>saves us from deadlock</b> <b>in situations like this.</b></p>

		<p>But it is a common <b>misconception</b> that...</p>

		<li>
		<p>Should we <b>assume</b> an object is thread-safe because it seems that it <b>ought to</b> be? </p>
