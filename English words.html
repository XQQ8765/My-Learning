		<b>Dear Employees</b>,
		</p>
		<p>	
		<b>You may have already heard the news today that</b> Quest <b>entered into an agreement with</b> Insight Venture Partners to become a privately held company. <b>I've attached to this email</b> the news release and an FAQ which provide more detail about the agreement. <b>I also wanted to share my perspective and to explain why I believe this is good news.</b>
		</p>	
		<p>	
		<b>From an operations perspective</b>, we expect Quest to <b>continue in much the same way as before</b>. We plan to <b>remain a market leader in</b> enterprise systems management software <b>with a focus on continued innovation and superior service</b>. 
		</p>	
		<p>	
		<b>Under this agreement</b>, we would no longer <b>be listed as</b> a public company. The Company would partner with Insight Venture Partners, an early investor in Quest. Insight understands and appreciates the value and the prospects for our business and is committed to Quest¡¯s future success. <b>I believe this new structure will provide even greater flexibility in the marketplace as</b> Quest <b>executes its strategies to meet the needs of our customers</b>, while <b>providing exciting career opportunities for you and your fellow employees</b>. 
		</p>	
		<p>	
		<b>I am committed to the future of our business</b>, and under this agreement, I would continue as Chairman and CEO and maintain a large ownership interest in this company.  <b>I believe strongly in Quest and am excited about where we are headed</b>. 
		</p>
		<p>	
		<b>Importantly</b>, <b>there are several more steps until </b>any <b>potential transaction</b> is completed. The major steps are described in the news release. We <b>expect</b> the transaction to close <b>during the third quarter of this year</b>. 
		</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>but here's the <b>gist</b>...</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Other thoughts, concerns, or ideas are <b>appreciated</b>...but let's <b>keep this within R&D until</b> we have <b>consensus</b> about these new plans.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>This was an <b>oversight</b> by me...</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>UnsafeSequence in Listing 1.1, which <b>is supposed to</b> generate a sequence of unique integer values, <b>offers a simple illustration</b> of how the interleaving of actions in multiple threads can <b>lead to undesirable results</b>. It <b>behaves correctly</b> in a single-threaded environment, but in a multithreaded environment does not.
		</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>
		<b>Diagrams like Figure 1.1 depict</b> possible interleavings of operations in different threads. 
		</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Reentrancy <b>saves us from deadlock</b> <b>in situations like this.</b></p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>But it is a common <b>misconception</b> that...</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Should we <b>assume</b> an object is thread-safe because it seems that it <b>ought to</b> be? </p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Updated UI to <b>accommodate</b> API changes for new Content Extraction Rule design</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>You are <b>awesome</b>!!</P>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Looks like something <b>coming out of</b> WCF-land.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Working memory is important because rules can only <b>react to</b> additions, deletions, and changes to working memory. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>In the syntax diagram, defaults for various options <b>are indicated in bold letters.</b>  </p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>A pattern with test <b>as the head</b> is special; the body consists not of a pattern to <b>match against</b> the working memory but of a Boolean function. <b>The result of evaluating this function determines</b> whether the pattern matches. A test pattern fails if and only if the function <b>evaluates to the symbol FALSE</b>; if it evaluates to TRUE or any other value, the pattern <b>with</b> "match." For example: ......</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><b>Therefore</b> the following two rules are <b>precisely equivalent</b> in behaviour. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>
		For example, <b>imagine that</b> you've <b>got two Java classes</b>, A and B, and that A has a method contains which <b>takes a B as an argument</b> and returns boolean. <b>Further</b>, imagine that for any given B object, the return value of contains will <b>change over time</b>. Finally, imagine that you've defined shadow fact templates for both these classes and are writing rules to work with them. <b>Under these circumstances</b>, a set of patterns like this:<br/> 
		....<br/>
		The correct way to <b>express</b> this same set of patterns is to use the test conditional element, like this: <br/>
		...<br/>
		The function contains <b>is now guaranteed to </b> <b>be called at most once for</b> each <b>combination</b> of target and argument, and so <b>any variation in</b> return value will <b>have no impact</b>. <br/>
		</p>

		After <b>a short couple of months with </b>Dell ... ok, <b>bad intro ...</b> Yu Liu, after almost 12 years with Sitraka, Quest and Dell has decided to leave us for greener soccer fields and his last day is August 31st.<br/>
		</p>
		...<br/>
		<p>
		Yu¡¯s <b>been part of my team</b> from <b>the first baby steps of</b> Foglight. He¡¯s <b>been instrumental in many areas of the product</b> as many of you know, since folks come by and are assured to find help from Yu in/around<br/>
		<p>
		...<br/>
		</p>
		<b>His clear-headed approach to how-things-work, how-things-might-look-better and his willingness to experiment, try-out and drive change will be sorely missed.</b> If you¡¯ve worked with him you know what I¡¯m talking about. <b>Yu¡¯s one of our developers who thinks outside the line-of-code; I know he¡¯ll do good wherever he goes.</b>
